Stem Journal is a club at Staples High School that publishes three journals a year. These journals are filled with review and summary articles from our talented contributors. 

This club provides a platform for students to foster their passion and interests in the STEM fields, and promote a mutual interest for the understanding of the complex and the beautiful world around us.
